        ## üîç Possible Causes
        - **Power Issues**: AC outlet problem, Power adapter issue, Damaged or Loosed Power Terminal Block connector, short-circuit on the output relays
        - **Network Issues**: Controller's ethernet/Wifi is not connected (Needs Blinkup for CP1 and CP2 with Rev Numbers below 553xxxxxx), Damaged or loose RJ45 connectors affecting power/data transmission; ethernet cable length (100m max)
        - **Hardware Malfunction**: Physical damage or internal component failure.
